The awards are presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and winners are selected by the Academy's voting membership. The various category winners are awarded a copy of a golden statuette, officially called the "Academy Award of Merit," but more commonly referred to by its nickname, the "Oscar".
